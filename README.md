👋 Hello there! I'm Mohamed Ibrahim, a passionate 14-year-old programmer from Egypt 🇪🇬. Currently in middle school, I'm deeply intrigued by the endless possibilities that programming offers.

🖥️ Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I love to craft web experiences and dive into the realm of backend development. As a proud Linux Fedora user, I feel right at home in the command line and enjoy exploring the vast capabilities of open-source software.

🌟 Beyond just coding, I'm also interested In Algebra, Geometery, Physics and literally every thing scientific!

💼 Proudly participating in DECI (Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative), a national programming initiative, I'm committed to contributing to the tech ecosystem of my country and beyond.
