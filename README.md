👋 Hello there! I'm Mohamed Ibrahim, a passionate 14-year-old programmer from Egypt 🇪🇬. Currently navigating the exciting world of middle school, I'm deeply intrigued by the endless possibilities that programming offers.

🖥️ Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I love to craft web experiences and dive into the realm of backend development. As a proud Linux Ubuntu user, I feel right at home in the command line and enjoy exploring the vast capabilities of open-source software.

🌟 Beyond just coding, I'm fascinated by the broader spectrum of programming and its applications across various domains. From web development to automation and beyond, I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.

💼 Proudly participating in DECI (Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative), a national programming initiative, I'm committed to contributing to the tech ecosystem of my country and beyond.

🚀 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects together! Feel free to reach out, whether it's for coding challenges, collaboration opportunities, or just a friendly chat about all things tech!
